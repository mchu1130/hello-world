# hello-world

Greetings world citizens.

I am Mike and I excited to be actively coding again. I am interested in analytics, particularly in finance. Also learning more about machine learning at the moment.

I enjoy running, snowboarding, exploring, learning new tricks and craft beers. Great to meet you and feel free to hit me up!
